      <h2>Nvidia stock hits all-time high as AI craze rolls on</h2>
      <p>Nvidia (NVDA) stocks hit an all-time high on Friday, as the AI craze continues to roll on in early 2024. Nvidia’s share price jumped more than 2% to $584.87 as of midday. Shares of the AI juggernaut are up some 18% in the first few weeks of the new year and 179% over the last 12 months. And its market cap is quickly approaching $1.5 trillion.
But Nvidia isn’t the only company benefiting from the AI hype. Rival AMD (AMD) hit an all-time intraday high on Thursday, topping out at $168.60 per share. The chipmaker is up 94% through the last 12 months. Shares of Intel (INTC) jumped 57% over the same period.
Nvidia got a huge vote of confidence on Thursday when Meta (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced that the company is spending billions of dollars to acquire thousands of Nvidia chips for its AI projects. In an Instagram Reels post, Zuckerberg said Meta will build out AI infrastructure complete with 350,000 Nvidia H100 chips by the end of 2024 with the goal of developing general artificial intelligence.Zuckerberg also said he wants to make Meta’s general AI open source, allowing others to use and work with it.</p>

      <h2>Housing Recession Is Over</h2>
      <p>Contract signings picked up the pace last month, and home buyers are increasingly facing multiple offer situations. NAR releases its housing forecast for the remainder of the year and 2024.Pending home sales rose slightly in June, and the latest indicators are showing a housing market on the mend. Median existing-home sales prices in June soared to their second highest on record in the last two decades, and more buyers are facing multiple offer situations once again, the latest reports from the National Association of REALTORS® shows. NAR’s Pending Home Sales Index—a forward-looking indicator of home sales based on contract signings—rose 0.3% in June, the first increase in four months.
“The recovery has not taken place, but the housing recession is over,” says Lawrence Yun, NAR’s chief economist. “The presence of multiple offers implies that housing demand is not being satisfied due to a lack of supply. Homebuilders are ramping up production and hiring workers.” 
Housing inventories remain at historical lows, down 13.6% from even last year’s low levels. “There are simply not enough homes for sale,” Yun said in a recent report. Seventy-six percent of existing homes sold in June were on the market for less than a month, NAR’s data shows.
Home buyers are faced with limited choices, higher home prices and higher mortgage rates. But they may find some relief soon: Mortgage rate increases may be mostly over, and that would bode well for home-buying, Yun says. 
“With consumer price inflation calming close to the Federal Reserve’s desired conditions, mortgage rates look to have topped out,” Yun says. “Given the ongoing job additions, any meaningful decline in mortgage rates could lead to a rush of buyers later in the year and into the next.”
NAR forecasts that the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage could reach 6.4% by the end of the year, followed by 6% in 2024. Over recent weeks, mortgage rates have been nearing 7%, far from their ultra-low 2% or 3% averages just over a year ago. </p>
